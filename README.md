# The-Profit

Alice has started stock trading and loves it. She knows the prices of a share of a particular company over the next "N" days. She wants to analyze this data to build a model which can predict the best day to buy and sell the shares. Given an amount, she wants to know if the given desirable amount of profit can be made. If yes, she wants to know the minimum number of days in which it can be made. If there are multiple ways of buying and selling to achieve that profit, she wants to know the way which happens the earliest.

Note: Alice can buy only 1 share and not more. She always has to buy before she can sell the share.
